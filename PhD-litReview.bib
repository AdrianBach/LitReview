abstract = {Abstract 1.Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is a powerful tool for simulating all key aspects of natural resource management under conditions of uncertainty. 2.We present the R package GMSE, which applies genetic algorithms to provide a generalised tool for simulating adaptive decision-making management scenarios between stakeholders with competing objectives under complex social-ecological interactions and uncertainty. 3.GMSE models can be agent-based and spatially explicit, incorporating a high degree of realism through mechanistic modelling of links and feedbacks among stakeholders and with the ecosystem; additionally, user-defined sub-models can also be incorporated as functions into the broader GMSE framework. 4.We show how GMSE simulates a social-ecological system using the example of an adaptively managed waterfowl population on an agricultural landscape; simulated waterfowl exploit agricultural land, causing conflict between conservation interests and the interest of food producers maximising their crop yield. 5.The R package GMSE is open source under GNU Public License; source code and documents are freely available on GitHub.

abstract = "Conservation problems typically involve groups with competing objectives and strategies. Taking effective conservation action requires identifying dependencies between competing strategies and determining which action optimally achieves the appropriate conservation goals given those dependencies. We show how several real-world conservation problems can be modeled game-theoretically. Three types of problems drive our analysis: multi-national conservation cooperation, management of common-pool resources, and games against nature. By revealing the underlying structure of these and other problems, game-theoretic models suggest potential solutions that are often invisible to the usual management protocol: decision followed by monitoring, feedback and revised decisions. The kind of adaptive management provided by the game-theoretic approach therefore complements existing adaptive management methodologies."

    abstract = {{Eminently suited to classroom use as well as individual study, Roger Myerson's
introductory text provides a clear and thorough examination of the models,
solution concepts, results, and methodological principles of noncooperative
and cooperative game theory. Myerson introduces, clarifies, and synthesizes
the extraordinary advances made in the subject over the past fifteen years,
presents an overview of decision theory, and comprehensively reviews the
development of the fundamental models: games in extensive form and strategic
form, and Bayesian games with incomplete information.

\_Game Theory\_ will be useful for students at the graduate level in economics,
political science, operations research, and applied mathematics. Everyone who
uses game theory in research will find this book essential.}},

abstract = {Abstract:  Environmental policy makers are embracing consensus-based approaches to environmental decision making in an attempt to enhance public participation in conservation and facilitate the potentially incompatible goals of environmental protection and economic growth. Although such approaches may produce positive results in immediate spatial and temporal contexts and under some forms of governance, their overuse has potentially dangerous implications for conservation within many democratic societies. We suggest that environmental decision making rooted in consensus theory leads to the dilution of socially powerful conservation metaphors and legitimizes current power relationships rooted in unsustainable social constructions of reality. We also suggest an argumentative model of environmental decision making rooted in ecology will facilitate progressive environmental policy by placing the environmental agenda on firmer epistemological ground and legitimizing challenges to current power hegemonies that dictate unsustainable practices.}
